# Sensor Project

"Sensor" is a pet project I made with an arduino and raspberry pi. Using the device i you can connect to a server thats hosted on the raspberry pi and open the gui application. Using the gui application
you can calibrate, change the alert color and much more.

## How to Run
Its fairly simple:
  - Upload "Modules" code into the arduino
  - Upload "Pi Server" code on the raspberry pi
  - Use the command make and use the .sh program to start it on restart
  - Upload "client and GUI" to your own computer and use the command make
  - execute it
